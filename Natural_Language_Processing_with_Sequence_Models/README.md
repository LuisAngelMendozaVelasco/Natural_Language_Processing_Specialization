# Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models

In Course 3 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, you will:

- Train a neural network with word embeddings to perform sentiment analysis of tweets,
- Generate synthetic Shakespeare text using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) language model,
- Train a recurrent neural network to perform named entity recognition (NER) using LSTMs with linear layers, and 
- Use so-called ‘Siamese’ LSTM models to compare questions in a corpus and identify those that are worded differently but have the same meaning.

# Natural Language Processing Specialization

This specialization from DeepLearning.AI will equip you with machine learning basics and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques needed to build cutting-edge NLP systems:

- Use logistic regression, na√Øve Bayes, and word vectors to implement sentiment analysis, complete analogies, translate words, and use locality-sensitive hashing to approximate nearest neighbors.

- Use dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings to autocorrect misspelled words, autocomplete partial sentences, and identify part-of-speech tags for words.

- Use dense and recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, GRUs, and Siamese networks in TensorFlow to perform advanced sentiment analysis, text generation, named entity recognition, and to identify duplicate questions. 

- Use encoder-decoder, causal, and self-attention to perform advanced machine translation of complete sentences, text summarization, and question-answering. Learn models like T5, BERT, and more with Hugging Face Transformers!

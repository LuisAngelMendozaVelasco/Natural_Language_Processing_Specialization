# Machine Translation and Document Search

Learn to transform word vectors and assign them to subsets using locality sensitive hashing, in order to perform machine translation and document search.

## Learning Objectives

- Gradient descent
- Approximate nearest neighbors
- Locality sensitive hashing
- Hash functions
- Hash tables
- K nearest neighbors
- Document search
- Machine translation
- Frobenius norm
